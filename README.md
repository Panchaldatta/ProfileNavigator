# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Steps to follow -
- Clone the repository.
- npm install
- npm install -g json-server
- To start json server - enter this ( json-server --watch db.json --port 3000 )

After server starts hold 3 to 4 second on Home page to get load because I have used three.js library. The Earth is responsive to scroll zoom in and out. It also rotate hold click on the earth and rotate in any direction you want.
